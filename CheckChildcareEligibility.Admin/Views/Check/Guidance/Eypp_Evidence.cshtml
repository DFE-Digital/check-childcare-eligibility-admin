                    When checking an applicant with an asylum support reference number (formerly NASS number), a document proving they are receiving relevant support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 is needed. They must provide:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a letter from the Home Office confirming they receive financial support under section 95</li>
                    <li>an Application Residence Card (ARC) for themselves and any partner</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can also review other kinds of documentation at your discretion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the document provided demonstrates that they receive such support, this is sufficient evidence for them to claim early years pupil premium for their children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that some asylum seekers with a support reference number are claiming asylum under part IV of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. These claimants are not eligible.
