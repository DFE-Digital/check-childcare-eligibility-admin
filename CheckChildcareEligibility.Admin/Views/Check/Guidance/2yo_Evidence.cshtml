                    To see if a family can claim early learning for 2-year-olds, check their signed
                    application form confirming both their immigration category and 
                    that they are not above the maximum income threshold required for their area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Families can use the DfE <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/30-hours-free-childcare-la-and-early-years-provider-guide?">sample application form</a>, which also includes details of the
                    income thresholds, or they can use one created by a local authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can confirm proof of NRPF status from one of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the online <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-immigration-status?">Immigration Checking Service</a></li>
                    <li>an Application Residence Card (ARC)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To verify income, check one of the following for the applicant and their partner (if they have one), covering the last 3 months:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>payslips</li>

                    <li>letter from their employer confirming monthly salary</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You must also confirm that the applicant and their partner (if they have one) do not have more than £16,000 in capital (this includes savings, investments or other assets).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an applicant is an asylum seeker that receives financial support, you can ask to see a copy of a letter from the Home Office confirming that they have been awarded financial support.
